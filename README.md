# Study_on_Password_Hacking
The objective of this project is to evaluate the resilience of password security systems through the utilization of sophisticated hacking tools and methodologies, such as Hydra, auxiliary modules, NSE scripts, John the Ripper, and Crunch. 

The main goal is to identify vulnerabilities in password protection schemes typically employed in different systems. The research strives to evaluate the efficacy of current security by conducting systematic simulations of password attacks. By leveraging a combination of brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and password generation, the study aims to provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current password security implementations.
